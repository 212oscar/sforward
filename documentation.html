                    <summary><h3>Copy SF Case</h3></summary>
                    <p>We always need the SF case number for everything (claiming the case in slack, notes on p4, etc) thats why I've included
                        a dedicated button for this. Just click it and the case number will be copied to your clipboard.
                    </p>

                    <summary><h3>Create TRC</h3></summary>
                    <p>For new submissions review, I've included this button to quickly create a TRC using the Product title and SF Case
                        number, the first time you use any of the templates, the script will ask you to paste the Sheet Template ID.
                    </p>
                    <p>To get the Template sheet ID, use the following URL as an example:
                        <br><pre><code>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fYkeQQ_bLESF7aw4nswwiw_5ZI7IH6mp8yqIATX39MQ/edit?gid=1812179549#gid=1812179549</code></pre>
                        <br>The Template sheet ID is the part between `/d/` and `/edit`, which in this case is <pre><code>1fYkeQQ_bLESF7aw4nswwiw_5ZI7IH6mp8yqIATX39MQ</code></pre>
                    This is the ID you need to paste when the script asks for it. After the first time the script will remember the ID and will use it to create the TRCs</p>              
                    The first time the script will also ask you for a Google Drive folder where all these Sheets will be stored, I suggest using your folder
                    from the modsquad ID, this way you can have all the TRCs in one place, you can get your folder ID like this:</p>
                    <p>Go to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19n1Ar6HQbcjRqMEbqDGat1di2NEOBEM4" target="_blank">agent folders</a> Drive and enter in the folder with your name, you need to copy the ID of the folder the same way you did with the sheet.</p>
                </details></fieldset><br>
                <fieldset><legend>Change Case Status</legend>
                    <p>Salesforce is not too friendly when changing status, to avoid sending the wrong status I've included these clean
                        buttons for the most used status, just click the one you need and the status will be changed automatically in just 2 seconds, so make sure you already send the proper
                        email and/or did the full review before clicking these buttons.</p>

                                <p>With this button the script will ask you for your tanda calendar, just go to your Tanda schedule URL 
                                    (https://my.tanda.co/staff) you must be logged with Okta, click on your name / Attendance points / Schedules / Click on Subscribe iCal / Open that iCal URL, copy all that content, and paste it there.</p>
                                    <p>Now the script will know your shifts and the shift report button will be enabled, if you add more shifts to your schedule then you should "Update shifts" there is a button for that too.</p>
                                    <p>After you saved your calendar you can now enable reminders, so in case you forgot to clock out and you are still in Salesforce working, a small alert will popup with a reminder.</p>
