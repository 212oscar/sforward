                <details>
                    <summary><h3>Assign to me</h3></summary>
                    <p>With this button you can easily assign a SF case to you, just click it

                    <summary><h3>Get Info</h3></summary>
                    <p>Will show you a friendly summary of the app names
                        with YES in the colum of "Is New or Changed"
                    from this window you can easily see the supported versions for each app Name
                    copy the app name (to quickly find it in the Depot) or in case you are working
                    on a new submission or Adding a new version (update ADD case) you can click "P4V data"
                    and then with the other tool "P4Vhelper" you can click "Get data" and from there you can Quickly
                    create a folder in the P4V workspace, this will save you a lot of clicks. There is also a button "Horde"
                    that will quickly create the Job horde for you with just one click.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p>You can also see in the top of this section the warning color indicator of the seller, Case Type (New submission or Update) and the SF case</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary><h3>Copy SF Case</h3></summary>
                    <p>We always need the SF case number for everything (claiming the case in slack, notes on p4, etc) thats why I've included
                        a dedicated button for this. Just click it and the case number will be copied to your clipboard.
                    </p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary><h3>Create TRC</h3></summary>
                    <p>For new submissions review, I've included this button to quickly create a TRC using the Product title and SF Case
                        number, the first time you use any of the templates, the script will ask you to paste the Sheet Template ID.
                    </p>
                    <p>To get the Template sheet ID, use the following URL as an example:
                        <br><pre><code>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fYkeQQ_bLESF7aw4nswwiw_5ZI7IH6mp8yqIATX39MQ/edit?gid=1812179549#gid=1812179549</code></pre>
                        <br>The Template sheet ID is the part between `/d/` and `/edit`, which in this case is <pre><code>1fYkeQQ_bLESF7aw4nswwiw_5ZI7IH6mp8yqIATX39MQ</code></pre>
                    This is the ID you need to paste when the script asks for it. After the first time the script will remember the ID and will use it to create the TRCs</p>              
                    The first time the script will also ask you for a Google Drive folder where all these Sheets will be stored, I suggest using your folder
                    from the modsquad ID, this way you can have all the TRCs in one place, you can get your folder ID like this:</p>
                    <p>Go to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19n1Ar6HQbcjRqMEbqDGat1di2NEOBEM4" target="_blank">agent folders</a> Drive and enter in the folder with your name, you need to copy the ID of the folder the same way you did with the sheet.</p>
                </details></fieldset><br>
                <fieldset><legend>Change Case Status</legend>
                    <p>Salesforce is not too friendly when changing status, to avoid sending the wrong status I've included these clean
                        buttons for the most used status, just click the one you need and the status will be changed automatically in just 2 seconds, so make sure you already send the proper
                        email and/or did the full review before clicking these buttons.</p>
                    </p>

                                    the script fails to detect the case type, you can also delete the case from the log in case someone <s>steal</s> claim it first on slack and you have to take another.</p>
                                </p>

                                <p>With this button the script will ask you for your tanda calendar, just go to your Tanda schedule URL 
                                    (https://my.tanda.co/staff) you must be logged with Okta, click on your name / Attendance points / Schedules / Click on Subscribe iCal / Open that iCal URL, copy all that content, and paste it there.</p>
                                    <p>Now the script will know your shifts and the shift report button will be enabled, if you add more shifts to your schedule then you should "Update shifts" there is a button for that too.</p>
                                    <p>After you saved your calendar you can now enable reminders, so in case you forgot to clock out and you are still in Salesforce working, a small alert will popup with a reminder.</p>

                </ol>

                <h3>Q: Is this approved by management?</h3>
                <p>A: Currently i only have approval to ask the leads for testing it, still is not approved to share with all the mods.</p>
                <h3>Q: Will this break any Modsquad / Epic security policies?</h3>
                <p>A: I’ve re-reviewed the Workday policies (Epic) and I believe this script complies. It only uses visible Salesforce data, processes it 
                    locally in the browser via Tampermonkey (allowed on Island), and doesn’t store or share data externally. 
                    The code is fully transparent for anyone to review and ensures no breaches of policy. If you want the 
                    source code of the P4Vhelper i can send it to  you via Slack DM. Please if you know we are breaking some policy with some feature let me know.</p>
                <h3>Q: How do I use the P4V Helper program?</h3>
                <p>A: Follow the usage steps provided in the P4V Helper section.</p>
